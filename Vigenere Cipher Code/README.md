***Vigenere Cipher and Vigenere Breaker Code***
================================

This is a project that I made while taking up one of the courses on Coursera. 
<br></br>The program ciphers any given text using the Vigenere Cipher techniques, when provided with a key. The program is also able to work for dual keys. The program is proficient in working for multiple languages too.

<br></br>This program is also capable of deciphering the code with or without the key in lanuguages English, Dutch, Spanish, French, German, Italian and Portuguese using the classical cryptography techniques.
<br></br>In this project:
<li>Vigenere cipher with 1 key</li>
<li>Vigenere cipher with 2 keys</li>
<li>Vigenere breaker with/without 1 key</li>
<li>Vigenere breaker with/without 2 keys</li>
<li>All the above tasks in any of the provided languages</li>

<br></br>This project really helped me to have a better understanding of the Object Oriented Programming concepts in Java and also the basics of the vast world of Cryptography. I hope you like it.
