***Caeser Cipher and Caeser Breaker Code***
================================

This is a project that I made while taking up one of the courses on Coursera. 
<br></br>The program ciphers any given text using the Caeser Cipher techniques, when provided with a key. The program is also able to work for dual keys.

<br></br>This program is also capable of deciphering the code with or without the key, using the classical cryptography techniques.
<br></br>In this project:
<li>Caeser cipher with 1 key</li>
<li>Caeser cipher with 2 keys</li>
<li>Caeser breaker with/without 1 key</li>
<li>Caeser breaker with/without 2 keys</li>


<br></br>This project really helped me to have a better understanding of the Object Oriented Programming concepts in Java and also the basics of the vast world of Cryptography. I hope you like it.
