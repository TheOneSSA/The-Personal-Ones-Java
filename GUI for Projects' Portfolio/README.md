***GUI for Projects' Portfolio***
================================

This was the project thatI contributed in while my Summer internship at Tata Steel. The task was to find a better way to analyse the projects in the Financial Year-2019 and compare them with the projects for last 5 FY.
<br></br>The suggestion made by me was to make a GUI, which analyses the given data and displays it in the form of graphs for better visualization and understanding, where the type of graph is selected by the user.

<br></br>This was further incorporated in an industry project by my mentor.
<br></br>In this project:
<li>Data analysis and Data preprocessing has been performed on Company's dataset of projects in the FY-2019 and for last 5 years.</li>
<li>ImplementedÂ Apache POI, JavaFx, JFreeChart (open-sourced) libraries in Java.</li>


<br></br>This project really helped me to have a better understanding of the Object Oriented Programming concepts in Java. I hope you like it.
<br></br>I have also attatched the a sample file of the dataset that was used, and the sample graphs produced from them.
<br></br><br>***Thank You***</br>
